    <p><b>I wish Giovanni would kiss me. Oh, but there are so many reasons why this would
        be a terrible idea. To begin with, Giovanni is ten years younger than I am,
        and - like most Italian guys in their twenties - he still lives with his mother.
        These facts make him an unlikely romantic partner for me, considering that I am
        an educated American woman in my mid-thirties, who has just come through a failed
        marriage and an interminable divorce, followed immediately by a passionate love
        affair that ended in heartbreak. This has left me feeling about seven thousand years old.
        This is why I have been alone for many months now. This is why, in fact,
        I have decided to spend this entire year in celibacy. Giovanni is my Tandem Exchange Partner.
        He teaches me Italian and I teach him English. I discovered Giovanni a few weeks after
        I'd arrived in Rome, thanks to a big Internet cafe. He had posted a flier on the bulletin
        board explaining that a native Italian speaker was seeking a native English speaker for
        conversational language practice. Right beside his appeal was another flier with the same
        request, word-for-word identical in every way. The only difference was the contact information.
        One flier listed an e-mail address for somebody named Giovanni; the other introduced somebody
        named Dario. But even the home phone number was the same. Using my keen intuitive powers,
        I e-mailed both men at the same time, asking in Italian, "Are you perhaps brothers?" Giovanni
        wrote back: "Even better. Twins!" After meeting the boys, I began to wonder if perhaps I should
        change my rule a bit about remaining celibate this year. For instance, perhaps I could remain
        totally celibate except for keeping a pair of handsome twentyfive-year-old Italian twin brothers as lovers...
        But, no. No and no. I look for healing and peace that can only come from solitude. Anyway,
        by now, by the middle of November, Giovanni and I have become friends.</b></p>
